    "Vector\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "To infer the latent structure in our corpus we need a way to represent\n",
    "documents that we can manipulate mathematically. One approach is to represent\n",
    "each document as a vector of *features*.\n",
    "For example, a single feature may be thought of as a question-answer pair:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many times does the word *splonge* appear in the document? Zero.\n",
    "2. How many paragraphs does the document consist of? Two.\n",
    "3. How many fonts does the document use? Five.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is usually represented only by its integer id (such as `1`, `2` and `3`).\n",
    "The representation of this document then becomes a series of pairs like ``(1, 0.0), (2, 2.0), (3, 5.0)``.\n",
    "This is known as a *dense vector*, because it contains an explicit answer to each of the above questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know all the questions in advance, we may leave them implicit\n",
    "and simply represent the document as ``(0, 2, 5)``.\n",
    "This sequence of answers is the **vector** for our document (in this case a 3-dimensional dense vector).\n",
    "For practical purposes, only questions to which the answer is (or\n",
    "can be converted to) a *single floating point number* are allowed in Gensim.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, vectors often consist of many zero values.\n",
    "To save memory, Gensim omits all vector elements with value 0.0.\n",
    "The above example thus becomes ``(2, 2.0), (3, 5.0)``.\n",
    "This is known as a *sparse vector* or *bag-of-words vector*.\n",
    "The values of all missing features in this sparse representation can be unambiguously resolved to zero, ``0.0``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the questions are the same, we can compare the vectors of two different documents to each other.\n",
    "For example, assume we are given two vectors ``(0.0, 2.0, 5.0)`` and ``(0.1, 1.9, 4.9)``.\n",
    "Because the vectors are very similar to each other, we can conclude that the documents corresponding to those vectors are similar, too.\n",
    "Of course, the correctness of that conclusion depends on how well we picked the questions in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to represent a document as a vector is the *bag-of-words\n",
    "model*.\n",
    "Under the bag-of-words model each document is represented by a vector\n",
    "containing the frequency counts of each word in the dictionary.\n",
    "For example, assume we have a dictionary containing the words\n",
    "``['coffee', 'milk', 'sugar', 'spoon']``.\n",
    "A document consisting of the string ``\"coffee milk coffee\"`` would then\n",
    "be represented by the vector ``[2, 1, 0, 0]`` where the entries of the vector\n",
    "are (in order) the occurrences of \"coffee\", \"milk\", \"sugar\" and \"spoon\" in\n",
    "the document. The length of the vector is the number of entries in the\n",
    "dictionary. One of the main properties of the bag-of-words model is that it\n",
    "completely ignores the order of the tokens in the document that is encoded,\n",
    "which is where the name bag-of-words comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our processed corpus has 12 unique words in it, which means that each\n",
