# French Coreference Resolution System
French-CRS is a machine-learning based NLP framework for coreference resolution in French language. It is already trained using 25 syntactic/morphological features derived from ANCOR a French Oral Corpus. French-CRS has already trained under different language models and is ready to be incorporated for French text. It internaly uses other systems for mention and named entity detections. French-CRS is planned to be enriched by semantic features. This will let it be fitted for other tasks such as nomination detection in social media context.
