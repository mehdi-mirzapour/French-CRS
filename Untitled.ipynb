      "# French Coreference Resolution System\n",
      "French-CRS is a machine-learning based NLP framework for coreference resolution in French language. It is already trained using 25 syntactic/morphological features derived from ANCOR a French Oral Corpus. French-CRS has already pre-trained language models and it is ready to be incorporated for French text. It internaly uses other systems for mention and named entity detections. French-CRS is planned to be enriched by semantic features. This will let it be fitted for other tasks such as nomination detection in social media context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installing French-CRS\n",
      "French-CRS requires Python 3.6.1 or above and it calls internally following framework:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1- ÚFAL UDPipe.  \n",
      "2- spaCy for French Named Entitiy Detection.  \n",
      "3- CAREN (Coréférence par Application de RÉseaux de Neurones) for French mention detection.  \n",
      "4- JupyterLab Notebook (optional)  \n",
      "\n",
      "Quick installation guide:\n",
      "```\n",
      "  $ git clone https://github.com/mehdi-mirzapour/French-CRS\n",
      "  $ cd French-CRS\n",
      "  $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n",

      "ANCOR can be downloaded here:  http://www.info.univ-tours.fr/~antoine/parole_publique/  \n",
      "\n",
      "Notice: Downloading ANCOR corpus is not mandatory for running the CRS system. Pre-trained models are already introduced in the \"pre-trained language models\" folder. The jupyter notebook \"/demo/Text2CoreferenceChains.ipynb\" also describes how to actually integrate them.\n",
